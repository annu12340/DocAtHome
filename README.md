# Doc@home

The spread of the pandemic has caused a lot of changes in our lifestyle, people fearing to get outside their homes, transportation almost shut down and social distancing becoming all the more important. While the physical impact of COVID-19 can be assessed and treated, the mental impact is often ignored. Many people are experiencing emotional breakdowns and having depression. The new reality of prolonged quarantine period and lack of socialization are adding up the mental struggle. More than 50% of those suffering from mental health issues are not seeking treatment, due to social stigma. Doc@home is a web app build with an indention for helping to cope up with the current covid situation.

The app has 3 primary functions:-


### 1. Became an AI companion for those in quarantine
 The new reality of prolonged quarantine period and lack of socialization with other family members, friends and managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are all challenging for each one of us. This present environment in the country has increased stress and anxiety amongst the citizens.

### 2. Provide a connecting medium for doctors and patients  

Sometimes a chatbot might not be enough. You might need to seek professional help
The fear of traveling has resulted in the hampering of checkups of many people. Doc@home,  helps patients to take their routine checkups from the comfort of their homes without the scare of the virus. It helps any patient to connect with the doctor of their choice, from the list of available doctors, and book an appointment according to their convenience either in offline or online mode.

The app has 2 portals, one for the patients requiring the appointment, and the doctors available for consultation. The patients can enter their medical history, any undergoing medication, etc which can be viewed by the doctor if he/she confirms their appointment. The index page of the patient and the doctor shows all their upcoming consultations. The doctor is notified if there are any patients requiring their appointment, and have the option to either confirm or deny, which causes a corresponding notification to be sent to the patient.
The doctor can also send the prescription with detailed feedback to the patient after consultation, along with the consultation fee to be paid. The patient can view the feedback in the history tab of their portal, which also provides the facility to pay the consultation fee by redirecting them to the Google Pay web page.

### 3. Create a forum for discussion
Another big issue that we face during this  time, is the spreading covid related of fake news.  News with no scientific basies like standing in sun can kill corona and yorr pets can spreading rapidly Corona for covid are rapidly spreadly
It is estimated there over 800 deaths have occured due to what'sapp fake msg 

**Doc@home also tackles this issue**

I have created a forum (inspired by stack overflow website) that could help people differentiate fake news from the real ones. Here people can raise doubts regarding different aspects of COVID and get answers from professionals and other peers. It is a community-driven platform where doctors and ordinary people can meet and help each other out
